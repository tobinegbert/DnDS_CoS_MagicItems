## Level 4
### Protect the Verses
- As an action, you can touch the book and cast Arcane lock

### Esoteric Knowledge
- You gain proficiency in the arcana and religion skills. If you already have proficiency then you gain expertise in that skill.

### Ritual Caster
You have learned a number of spells that you can cast as rituals. These spells are written in a ritual book, which you must have in hand while casting one of them.

You can add spells to your ritual book. The spell must be on the cleric spell list, the spell's level can be no higher than half your level (rounded up), and it must have the ritual tag. The process of copying the spell into your ritual book takes 2 hours per level of the spell, and costs 50 gp per level. The cost represents the material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it.

The ritual spells listed below are already in the spellbook.

### Sculpt Spells
- Mystra Blesses you with additional protective knowledge. When you cast an evocation spell that affects other creatures that you can see, you can choose any number of them. You harness divine energy to protect the chosen creatures from the spell. The chosen creatures automatically succeed on their saving throws against the spell, and they take no damage if they would normally take half damage on a successful save.
