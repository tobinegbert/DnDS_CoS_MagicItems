# Features:
## Level 4:
### Fire Resistance:
- You gain resistance to fire damage.

### Fiendish Fortitude:
- The tattoo molds your body to better suit your patrons purposes. You gain proficiency with medium armor, shields, and martial weapons.
- In addition, your tattoo also guides your hand when you make a weapon attack. When you make a weapon attack using your pact weapon, you can use your Wisdom modifier, instead of Strength or Dexterity, for the attack and damage rolls.

### Eyes of Night: 
- You can see through the deepest gloom. You have dark-vision out to a range of 300 feet. In that radius, you can see in dim light as if it were bright light and in darkness as if it were dim light. This includes magical darkness.
- As an action, you can magically share a diluted form of this feature with one willing creature you can see within 30 feet of you, up to a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier. 
- For 1 hour the affected creatures eyes turn green and they gain dark-vision out to 60ft. They treat magical darkness created by you as regular darkness.
- The effect will end after an hour or when you use this ability on another creature. You can also freely end the effect on a creature.

## Level 6:
### Overcome Resistance:
- You can use your reaction to treat a number of creatures equal to your wisdom modifier as if they didn't have fire resistance.

### Dark One's Transmutation
- When you are concentrating on the darkness spell, you can use a bonus action to turn the inky blackness of the spell into a greasy oil. This action ends the darkness spell. Oil covers the same area that the darkness spell covered.
- Any creature that was within the darkness when the spell is converted is covered in oil. This oil can later be lit aflame, either manually or by targeting any creature on or covered by the oil with a spell that does fire damage. When the oil is lit it does fire damage to those on or covered in the oil.
	- Oil on the ground burns for 5 rounds, creatures that start their turn in the fire take 7 (2d6) fire damage.
	- Oil on a creature burns for 3 rounds but the creature can take an action to end the burning effect, creatures that start their turn on fire take 14 (4d6) fire damage.

### Blessing of the Dark One
- When you reduce an enemy creature to 0 hit-points, you can use your reaction to touch a willing creature within 5 feet to transfer the temporary hit-points to that creature instead of yourself. 
- Your patrons influence allows you to change the damage type of eldritch blast to fire.

## Level 8:
### Overcome Immunity, Immunity:
- Improves [[#Overcome Resistance|Overcome Resistance]], if the creatures have fire immunity, treat them as if they had resistance.
- Improves [[#Fire Resistance|Fire Resistance]] to immunity.

### 

## Level 10:
### Damage Absorption and Immunity
- You gain immunity to fire damage.
- When you take fire damage, you can use your reaction to regain a number of hit-points equal to half the damage you would've taken.

### Consecration of the Dark One
- You gain an extra spell slot. It is identical to your other warlock spell slots except that it can only be used to cast darkness or spells from your patrons spell list.

### False Life of the Dark One
- Improves upon [[#Blessing of the Dark One|Blessing of the Dark One]]
	- If you use Blessing of the Dark One on a downed ally, the temp hit-points will revive the downed player.
