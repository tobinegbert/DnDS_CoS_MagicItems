## Level 4:
### Sharpshooter
You have mastered ranged weapons and can make shots that others find impossible. You gain the following benefits:
-   Attacking at long range doesn't impose disadvantage on your ranged weapon attack rolls.
-   Your ranged weapon attacks ignore half and three-quarters cover.
-   Before you make an attack with a ranged weapon that you are proficient with, you can choose to take a -5 penalty to the attack roll. If that attack hits, you add +10 to the attack's damage.

### Wisdom of the Earth
This bow allows the user to attune to the land around it and hear the whispers of all living things giving them guidance. You gain the following benefits:
- You gain the ability to see in magical darkness as if it were normal darkness.
- You gain a +1 bonus to all wisdom skill checks
- When an ally within 30 feet of you makes a skill check, you can share the wisdom you have learned by projecting the whispers into their ears. They may add a d6 to the skill check. You may use this feature a number of times equal to your wisdom modifier. This resets on a long rest

### Favored Foe
You can call on your bond with nature to mark a creature as your favored enemy for a time: you know the hunter's mark spell, and Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for it. You can use it a certain number of times without expending a spell slot and without requiring concentration—a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

Hunter's mark doesn't count against the number of ranger spells you know.

### Reliable Talent
The bow requires extreme accuracy from its wielder in all things. You gain the following benefits:
- If you roll lower than a 5 on any ability check that you have expertise in, you treat the roll as if it were a 5.
- You gain expertise in one skill of your choice.

## Level 6:
This weapon becomes a +1 magic weapon

### Magically Focused
Your fighter levels count as ranger levels for the purposes of spell progression

### Initiating Strike
You are at your deadliest when you get the drop on your enemies. You have advantage on attack rolls against any creature that hasn't taken a turn in the combat yet. In addition, if the target hadn't taken a turn in combat, the first attack you make as part of the attack action is automatically a critical hit. If you hit a creature in this way you can command an ally to spend their reaction to move up to their movement and make a single attack.

*Note: This could potentially proc up to three times over two separate turns depending on how we run surprise rounds and if I have action surge. If we play it as we surprise someone who is unaware and there is a surprise round where they do not go. Then it is possible to attack, action surge attack, then the first actual round starts and if I have a higher initiative it can proc again*

### Insightful Fighting
Choose one creature you can see. As a bonus action, you can make an insight check opposed by the creatures deception check. If you succeed you learn how the creature fights. You learn the creatures armor class. You also gain the benefits listed below. This feature can be used once if the creature is not in combat, or as many times as you wish if they are engaged in combat. If the insight requires an attack it applies to the next attack you make on this turn. You can choose one of the following insights to learn about the creature:
- **Sharpshooter:** Your penalty for using sharpshooter decreases by 1. This effect can stack up to 3 times.
- **Disarm:** You can use a weapon attack to knock a weapon or another item from a target’s grasp. You make an attack roll contested by the target’s Strength (Athletics) check or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. If the attacker wins the contest, the attack causes damage to be halved and the defender drops the item. The attacker has disadvantage on its attack roll if the target is holding the item with two or more hands. The target has advantage on its ability check if it is larger than the attacking creature, or disadvantage if it is smaller.
- **Trip:**
- **Distract:**

### Expose Weakness
When you have successfully used your insightful fighting against one enemy twice, as part of the bonus action to study them you can share your insights on their weaknesses with an ally. The next ally (excluding you) to make an attack against that creature does so with advantage. [Or add 1d6??]

### Reliable Talent Improvement
If you roll lower than a 5 on any ability check that you have proficiency in, you treat the roll as if it were a 5. 

In addition you gain expertise in a skill of your choice

## Level 8:
### Improved Favored Enemy:
Whenever you attack a favored enemy you deal an additional 5 damage.

### Raven Queen's Gift
For the purposes of spell progression you are counted as having one additional cleric level

### Oracle Shot
As an action you may shoot an arrow from this bow. You may magically project your senses through the arrow that was fired. For 10 minutes you can see and hear as if from the arrow. You can do this a number of times per day equal to your [proficiency or wisdom] modifier

### Unerring Skill
I choose Stealth
Choose one ability that you have expertise in. If you roll lower than a 10 on any ability check that uses that skill, you treat the roll as if it were a 10.

## Level 10:
This weapon becomes a +2 magic weapon

### Arsenal of Arrows
When you make an attack with this bow you can choose to make it with a special arrow, you must specify before you roll for the attack. Each arrow has different effects and you choose what kind of arrow to shoot when you make the attack. You make an attack roll as normal, if the attack hits then the effects of the arrow are applied. If the arrow requires a saving throw the DC is equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier. If the attack was a critical hit, the target has disadvantage on any saving throws from the arrow. The types of arrows you can choose from are listed below.
- **Paralytic Arrow:** A creature hit by this arrow must make a constitution save or be paralyzed for 1 minute. They can make a new saving throw at the end of each of their subsequent turns
- **Sticky Arrow:** The creature is rooted to the ground. Their speed becomes zero. If they are prone they cannot stand up. The creature can make a strength check equal to the DC in order to break free.

### Swift Quiver
The Swift Quiver spell can be cast using a 4th level spell slot

### Remarkable Precision
When you attack with this weapon you score a critical hit on a 19 or 20.

### Unerring Skill Improvement
I choose perception
Choose another skill that you have expertise with. That skill now also works with unerring skill
