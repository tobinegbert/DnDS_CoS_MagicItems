## Mystra's Guiding Hand
_Evocation cantrip_

**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Self
**Components:** S, M (a melee weapon)  
**Duration:** Instantaneous

You brandish the weapon used in the spell’s casting and make a melee weapon attack using your spell attack modifier instead of the normal modifier. The target of the spell must be one creature within that weapons range. On a hit, the target suffers the weapon attack’s normal effects, and you can cause brilliant flames to leap to a different creature of your choice that is within 5ft of the original creature. The second creature takes radiant damage equal to your spellcasting ability modifier.

**At Higher Levels.** At 5th level, the melee attack deals an extra 1d8 radiant damage to the target on a hit, and the radiant damage to the second creature increases to 1d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier. Both damage rolls increase by 1d8 at 11th level (2d8 and 2d8) and 17th level (3d8 and 3d8).
